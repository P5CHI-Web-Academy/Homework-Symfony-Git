# Homework Shirkov Andrew

HI all ! my name is Andrew. I have always been fascinated by computers, and since I was in elementary school I knew I would end up in a career working with them. My first exposure to programming came actually quite late in university and it was written in C++. 
The first work was in the field of web development. Currently Iâ€™m writing in C# language.
My hobbies: cycling, designing and assembling various IoT devices.
